# Flight-Route-Optimizer
This project implements flight route optimization using various data structures such as graphs, hash tables, linked lists, and stacks. It allows users to book flights and finds the ideal route based on either the least time duration or the least price. The project utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm for route optimization.

Features
Flight Booking: Users can search for available flights and book tickets.

Route Optimization: The system finds the optimal route based on user preferences: either minimizing time duration or minimizing price.

Dijkstra's Algorithm: The project employs Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in the flight network.

Data Structures: Utilizes graph nodes for representing airports, hash tables for efficient retrieval of passenger data, linked lists for storing passenger information, stack for flight history of a passenger.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Implemented in Java.
Data Structures: Graphs, hash tables, linked lists, stacks.
Algorithm: Dijkstra's algorithm for route optimization.
